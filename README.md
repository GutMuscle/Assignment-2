This repository contain two python codes which are as follows
Task 1 : 
For the first line we are taking input from the user (a number), in the next two lines we are checking if the number is even or not , if its even then it will get print(which will be checked through a logic/equation) if not then next two lines will be executed(else part).
Task 2:
In first line we are initalizing sum variabble, in next line (2) we use a for loop to iterate through each number from 1 to 50 , inside this loop we are adding current number to the sum and after the loop ends we get our final output which is sum of integers between 1 to 50.
